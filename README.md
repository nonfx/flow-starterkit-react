**About flow**
Flow is a design framework that aims to be the fastest way to go from prototype to implementation. You can learn more about [@cldcvr/flow-core](https://github.com/cldcvr/flow-core/blob/main/ABOUT.md).

**Flow starer kit - ReactJS**
The purpose of the starter kits is to get a new frontend project up and running with all the basic requirements. You can add, remove or modify anything and use any other libraries /tools you prefer. Each starter kit comes baked with

-   ReactJS
-   [flow-core](https://github.com/cldcvr/flow-core) - building blocks for all flow components, templates, dependencies, and themes.
-   [flow-icons](https://github.com/cldcvr/flow-icon) - system icons for a basic interface
-   layouts

# Features

-   Responsive templates (top-nav and left-nav)
-   Interactions ready, for example - Clicking on the profile icon, will open a profile details popup
-   Dark and light theme
-   Custom themes (coming soon)
-   [Swappable templates](https://flow.cldcvr.com/templates/index.html)
